Support for newly released ACS data will no longer require updating getcensus.\n\n\n\n2.1.3\n\nRestored support for retrieving multiple years of 5-year estimates for geography(metro) if 2021 is one of the requested years (#66).\ngetcensus will now throw an error if a user specifies anything other than two-digit code(s) to statefips() or anything other than three-digit code(s) to countyfips() (#60).\n\n\n\n2.1.2\n\nFixed an issue where getcensus could not retrieve 2021 5-year estimates for metropolitan/micropolitan statistical areas (#61). However, retrieving multiple years of 5-year estimates for geography(metro) if 2021 is one of the requested years is not supported at this time. For example, getcensus B19013, years(2012 2021) sample(5) geography(metro) will throw an error. This will be fixed in a future release.\ngetcensus now throws an informative error if statefips() is specified with geography(zcta) for data years/samples where the Census Bureau API does not support retrieving data for zip code tabulation areas within specific states (#63).\nSupplying an API key is now optional (#62).\nIf an unsupported year is requested, users are prompted to try updating getcensus in addition to checking the ACS data release schedule (#64).\n\n\n\n2.1.1\n\ngetcensus now supports 2021 5-year estimates\n\n\n\n2.1.0\n\ngetcensus now defaults to year(2021) to retrieve data for 2021\ngetcensus now allows 3-year estimates for all years available on the API: 2007 to 2013\n\n\n\n2.0.1\n\nGeographic identifier variables are now returned in an appropriate str format (#57)\ngetcensus now throws an informative error message when the API key is invalid (#56)\n\n\n\n2.0.0\n\nNew features\n\nSupport for 12 geographic areas:\n\nalaska native regional corporation\namerican indian area/alaska native area/hawaiian home land\ncombined statistical area\nstate legislative district (lower chamber)\nstate legislative district (upper chamber)\nnew england city and town area\ncombined new england city and town area\nurban area, school district (elementary)\nschool district (secondary)\npublic use microdata area\nzip code tabulation area\n\nUsers may specify the full name or an abbreviation to geography().\nAdditional metadata: The name of each variable’s table is saved as a variable note. Different tables have different universes which are described in the table name rather than the variable names, and it is important for users to be aware of the universe for a given estimate, especially as users may be retrieving variables from multiple tables. The table name note may not appear for all years and product types, as occasionally this field is missing from the API data dictionaries.\nDialog box: When getcensus is called without arguments, a dialog box opens. The dialog box provides access to all getcensus functionality. This replaces the limited getcensus “interactive mode”, which operated through the Results window. Alternatively, users may call the getcensus dialog box by typing db getcensus.\n\n\n\nBreaking changes\n\nIn geography(), “bg” replaces “block” to refer to the “block group” geography. “Block” is a distinct census geography for which ACS estimates are not available.\nIn geography(), “unsd” replaces “sch” to refer to the “unified school district” geography. With the addition of elementary and secondary school district as supported geographies (see above), “sch” is too ambiguous.\nThe nolabel option’s abbreviation is now nolab, which is consistent with Stata’s built-in programs.\nKeywords:\n\npop has been removed.\npov and povrate have been combined into pov.\nsnap now includes variables on the percent of SNAP-participating households with a person aged 60 or older. The variable ID for median income among SNAP-participating households has been corrected.\nmedicaid now includes the percent, as well as the number, of individuals covered by Medicaid or other means-tested coverage (overall and by age group).\n\n\n\n\nOther changes\n\nsample() replaces dataset(), as it is more consistent with ACS terminology. Also, in the future getcensus may support other Census datasets, such as the decennial census and population estimates, so we’d like to preserve the dataset() option for future development. For now, the dataset() option is retained for compatibility; if specified, its contents are copied into sample().\ngetcensus now more thoroughly checks the availability and validity of users’ requests before sending them to the API. This means users can expect more (informative) error messages from getcensus, and fewer failed API calls.\ngetcensus now prints API call URLs to the Results pane without “&gt;” preceding each line break, for easier copy-pasting into a web browser.\nWhen one or more variable labels have been truncated, a single message is displayed rather than a message for each truncated label.\nIn the help file and error messages, data points are now referred to as “variables” rather than estimates. This is consistent with the Census Bureau’s API documentation and user guide. It also avoids confusion (“1-year estimates”, “estimate” versus “margin of error”).\nA rewritten help file provides more information on supported geographies and geographic components, includes more links to Census Bureau resources, and is more clearly organized.\n\n\n\nUnder the hood\ngetcensus version 2.0.0 is a full refactor of the program. Contributors should review dev/README.md.\n\n\n\n1.1.0\nMain program\n\nAdd explicit support for data years 2005-2009\nImproved and stricter handling of errors when user passes unsupported year-dataset or year-product combinations\nSome cleanup related to deprecation of product option\n\n\n\n1.0.0\nMain program\n\nAdd geographic component (e.g. metro/non-metro) option (#11)\nLabel margin of error variables (#12)\nClarify handling of mixed-up geoid and statefips options (#18)\nNew keywords to easily retrieve poverty ratio tables (#21)\nLabel variables using data dictionary for most recent data year requested by user (#24)\n\nHelp file\n\nClarify usage of product option (#14)\nCorrect description of cache option and rename to cachepath\nSeveral typo fixes and minor edits\nAdd link to GitHub page\n\n\n\n0.1.2\nMain program\n\nFix issue #13\nWhen saveas option used, new message tells users the path to the saved files.

The underlying data is available through the Census Bureau Application Programming Interface (API).1\nTo obtain data from the API, you will need to know the table ID and variable ID of the data point you are interested in. Each table that the Census Bureau publishes on data.census.gov has a unique table ID, and each data point within a table has a unique variable ID. For instance, ACS table S1701, Poverty status in the past 12 months, contains the estimated number of people in poverty. The variable ID for this data point is S1701_C02_001.",
